# skill-based-income-generator
A Python-based desktop application that estimates potential income ranges based on selected technical skills.
The project uses a simple and clean graphical user interface built with Tkinter, focusing on usability, clarity, and maintainable code.
**#Project Overview**
The Skill-Based Income Generator allows users to select a technical skill from a dropdown menu and instantly view an estimated monthly income range.
This project was developed as a hands-on exercise to strengthen Python fundamentals, GUI development, and logical structuring of small applications.

**#Features**
1.Dropdown-based skill selection.
2.Default skill selection to avoid empty inputs.
3.Clear / Reset button for better user experience.
4.Dictionary-based logic for fast skill–income mapping.
5.Error handling using message dialogs.

**#Technologies Used**
1.Programming Language: Python
2.GUI Framework: Tkinter
3.Concepts Applied:
a)Event-driven programming
b)Data structures (Dictionary)
c)Basic UI/UX principles
d)Modular function design
